============

My Breakout variant for CS106A (the first intro CS class at Stanford), cleaned
up so that it's runnable.

This is one of the first programs I ever wrote, back when I first discovered
computer science in the intro CS classes at Stanford. They had a policy where
students were encouraged to make "extensions" to assignments, so for this
assignment—implement a game of Breakout—I went over the edge :)

This is featured in my friend's movie, Stealth Mode, and I will rewrite it for
browsers ASAP, and see if I can make it an interesting game.
